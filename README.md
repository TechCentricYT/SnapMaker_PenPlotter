# SnapMaker_PenPlotter
A PowerShell script that connects and send gcode commands to a SnapMaker 2.0.

May work on SnapMaker 1.0 but unable to test that.

You do not need to have the 3d print, cnc, or laser module connected. This script sends the commands directly to the SnapMaker.

Example command line.
